										What’s a Business Cash Advance?
									
									<p>	Our business cash advances convert your future credit and debit receipts into immediate cash. Repayments are based on a fixed percentage of these future receipts rather than a fixed monthly payment. Our advances are cash flow-friendly, so we don’t get paid until you get paid!
